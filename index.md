Clearsale ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our Clearsale app and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

## Information We Collect

### Anonymous User Accounts

Our app uses Firebase Authentication to create anonymous user accounts. This does not require you to provide any personal information such as email or name. The anonymous account is used solely to:
- Enable secure access to app features
- Store your app preferences and settings
- Allow you to make in-app purchases

### App Usage Data

We collect minimal usage data to improve our services, including:
- Basic device information (device type, operating system version)
- App performance metrics
- Feature usage statistics

### User Preferences and Settings

The app securely stores:
- Your app preferences and settings
- Configuration data you enter within the app
- Terms and conditions acceptance status

All sensitive data is stored using encryption.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve our app
- Process your in-app purchases
- Fulfill the purposes for which you provided the information
- Notify you about changes to our app or policies

## Data Storage and Security

- All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods
- We use Firebase Cloud services for secure data storage and processing
- We implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access

## Third-Party Services
